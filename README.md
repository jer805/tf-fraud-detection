# Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Using TensorFlow against a Random Forest Classifier
Neural network and random forest algorithms offer two contrasting approaches to solve this binary classification problem on high dimensionality data from the [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/) kaggle competition.

In this vignette, issues related to the class imbalance problem presented by the data are discussed, as well as metrics to use in evaluating the models' success and the benefits of choosing one model over the other.
